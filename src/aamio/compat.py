"""Whether this client and a service fit, decided from what the service says it can do.

A version number cannot answer that. On 18 September 2026 the service said
0.7.0, GitHub 0.6.4 and PyPI 0.6.3, and an outside assessment asked, fairly,
which of those go together. None of the numbers says: a client and a service
are versioned apart, and have to be. What can be compared is the protocol and
the capabilities a service declares in its descriptor against the ones a
client needs, and the ones it merely uses when they are there.

    full      every capability this client uses is declared
    partial   the client works, and some of what it offers will not
    refuse    the protocol is another one, or something the client cannot
              work without is missing
