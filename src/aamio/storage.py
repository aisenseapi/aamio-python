"""What this runtime keeps on the machine, who can read it, and for how long.

The service forgets a thread when it expires. This runtime does not: it keeps a
key, the read keys of open threads, an outbox, and, unless told otherwise, an
archive of decrypted messages. "Ephemeral" is about the network, and an outside
assessment on 18 September 2026 pointed out how easily it is read as a promise
about the whole system, and that mode 600 says little on Windows, where
inherited ACLs decide who reads a file.

So three things live here. Every file is opened private from its first byte.
A check says who can in fact read the home, by mode bits where those mean
something and by the access control list where they do not. And the archive is
a choice with a lifetime: keep, off, or so many days, with a ceiling on size.
