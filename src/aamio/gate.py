"""Gate: the conditions an inbox sets for whoever writes to it, from the writer's side.

From aamio 0.5.0 an inbox can be opened with a gate. This module reads one and
decides what the writer does about it, with no network of its own:

- proof of work advised at up to 18 bits is done without asking;
- proof of work required at up to 32 bits is done when it fits in the time the
  inbox still takes writes, and a 428 is answered by doing it and sending
  again, once;
- work that would not be done before the inbox closes is not started, and
  the send stops with how long the work takes here and how long is left;
- a requirement above what this client computes stops the send, and says why;
- a condition this client does not know stops the send under require, since
  it cannot meet what it does not understand, and is passed over and
  mentioned under advise.

The ceilings are the service's own, 32 required and 18 advised. An inbox run by
a stranger can therefore never make this client spend more CPU than aamio lets
any inbox ask for, and aamio can never advise something an up to date client
would skip. 32 bits is for an inbox that means to meet only writers with real
compute: it takes this client more than an hour, so it says no up front.
