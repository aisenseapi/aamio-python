"""What the model is told about a message, a failure, and a tool.

Three things were flattened on the way out of the local MCP server, and each
one removed the distinction a reader needs to act on.

A read stripped `from_key`, so two different strangers both arrived as
"unknown key" and could not be told apart. The key is the sender's public
Ed25519 key — the same value that sits on every board post — not a secret.

A failed send was reduced to `str(error)`. The outcome, the status and the
message id are all known at that point; the id was not even in the sentence.
Refused and unknown want opposite reactions, and a model with neither the id
nor the distinction will simply send again.

Every tool said `destructiveHint: false`, closing a thread and withdrawing a
board post included, and the receipt tool called itself read-only although
`anchor` publishes to an external service. Hints are not a permission check,
but a wrong hint shown to a person is worse than no hint.
