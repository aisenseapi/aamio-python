"""A thread at an address can go, and a new one can open at the same address.

Threads live on tmpfs. A restart takes them, and a write to an address whose
thread is gone opens a new one there that counts from one again, with the
default lifetime and none of the old allowlist. Three things went quiet:

  * a read of the missing thread answered 200 with no messages, and nothing
    here looked at exists, so a thread that was gone read as a quiet inbox;
  * once the new thread was open, the old cursor was past everything in it,
    and the reader was shown nothing until the new thread passed the old
    count, so every message before that was never delivered;
  * the service now resets such a cursor and says so, but this runtime kept
    the higher of its cursor and the last seq, asked past the new thread again
    on every call, and would have handed the same messages over each time.
