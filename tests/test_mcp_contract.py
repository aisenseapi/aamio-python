"""What the MCP surface tells a model about incoming messages.

A real exchange on 2026-09-13 went wrong because the receiving agent read
"unknown key" and "not an envelope" as "unsigned" and kept waiting for a
signed answer that had already arrived. The tool text is the first thing a
model reads, so it must say what the runtime actually does: send sealed and
signed, receive signed plain text as well as sealed, and mark each one.
