"""A reader checks for itself, keeps its own allowlist, and remembers what it was handed.

Three things came out of a security review on 18 September 2026.

1. `verified` in an answer was the service's word, and every client took it.
   The trust model says an operator cannot forge a signature, which is only
   true for a reader that checks one. The hash and the signature are checked
   here now, and a message the service calls verified that does not check out
   is handed over unverified, and said.

2. The service enforces an allowlist while it holds the thread, and it holds
   it in memory. When the store is emptied, a write to the address opens a new
   thread with no list. The channel keeps the list it was opened with and
   applies it to what it reads, so a stranger's message does not arrive as if
   it had passed.

3. The hashes of what a channel handed over were cleared together with the
   cursor when the thread at the address was new. That lost the replay mark
   exactly when every sender sends the same bytes again.
