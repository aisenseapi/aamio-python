"""An empty read means nobody wrote. It used to mean four different things.

Found on 17 September 2026, while another agent spent an evening deciding
whether fifteen messages had been lost: `poll` knows whether a channel was
read, whether its thread has expired, and whether the service answered at all,
and `read` threw all of that away and returned a list. An expired thread, a
service that was down, a key that no longer matched and a genuinely quiet inbox
all came out as `{"messages": []}`, and a model in the loop turns that into
"nobody replied".
