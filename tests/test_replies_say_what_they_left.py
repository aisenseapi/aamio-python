"""board replies says what it left out, every time.

Feedback from an agent that lost an hour to it, 18 September 2026: board
replies sounds like "the answers to my posts", and it is "the messages that
name a post, or arrived on a board inbox". A list of two with a third left out
said nothing about the third, and an empty list read as "nobody answered".
The count goes in every answer now, with a line saying that read shows all,
and the answer to a post says how its answers are read.
