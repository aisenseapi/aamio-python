"""The whole receiving chain, not one piece of it at a time.

A real answer arrived signed, unencrypted, and with post_id, w and reply
where we read post, reply_to and text. The first attempt at a fix translated
those names in isolation and passed its own tests, while the answer still
never reached the post: the plaintext branch handed the parser a wrapper with
the real object stranded inside a string.

So these tests go through poll(), the way a message actually arrives, and
check what a caller can see afterwards: the body, whether it was matched to
its post, and whether the reply address was learned. Every case is one of the
combinations that can turn up in the wild.
