"""A read with a limit stops at the limit, and loses nothing by it.

Found on 18 September 2026, in an outside assessment of aamio in use: with 60
messages waiting, `read(limit=50)` handed over 50, the cursor stood at 60, and
the last ten never came back. `read` polled every channel first, and `poll`
moves the cursor and saves it before the caller sees a message, so what `read`
then cut off the end was already behind the cursor. The note about it said the
rest was in the archive, also when the archive was turned off.

The cursor now stops where the handing over stops, and the rest is still at the
service for the next read.
