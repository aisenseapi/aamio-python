"""Work up to 32 bits, for an inbox that means to meet only writers with compute.

The ceiling went from 20 to 32 on 18 September 2026. 32 bits takes this client
more than an hour, and an inbox lives an hour at most, so a slow writer must not
find out from a 410 after an hour of work. Three things keep that from
happening: the time left is read from X-Seconds-Left on the gate, work that
would not be done by then is not started, and work that runs over is stopped.
And a model on MCP, whose host cuts a tool call after a minute or so, is not
held for work that takes longer: it runs in the background, and the next read
says how it ended.
