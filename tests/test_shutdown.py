"""After close, this runtime writes nothing more.

From an outside assessment of aamio in use, 18 September 2026 (AAM-026). The
pollers are daemon threads in a long poll of up to twenty seconds. close()
saved, released the home and returned, and a poller that came back afterwards
moved its cursor, saved state.json and wrote to the archive, in a home the next
process might already hold. And the messages it had just read went into a
queue nobody would read again, behind a cursor that had moved past them.
