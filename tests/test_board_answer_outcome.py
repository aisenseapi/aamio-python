"""An answer to a post is a send, and its outcome is told like one.

Found on 18 September 2026, in an outside assessment of aamio in use. `send`
writes an outbox entry before the first attempt, and tells three outcomes
apart: delivered, refused, and unknown when no answer came back at all, since
the message may be on the other side. `board_answer` posted the envelope
directly. When the network gave no answer it raised "answer failed", with no
message id and nothing in the outbox, so the only move left was to answer
again: a new envelope with a new nonce, which the poster's reader cannot tell
from a second answer. Sent through the outbox, the same bytes go again, and a
second copy is marked a replay where it lands.
