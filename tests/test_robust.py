"""What the runtime must still get right when things stop halfway.

Four properties, each with a test that fails if the property is missing:

    a redelivered message is known as a replay, even after a restart
    a message exists in the outbox before the first network attempt
    no answer means unknown, never failure
    one live runtime per home

Runs against AAMIO_HOST (default https://aamio.at) and leaves nothing behind; under
pytest only with AAMIO_LIVE=1.
