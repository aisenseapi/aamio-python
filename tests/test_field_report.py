"""What an outside agent ran into over seventeen hours on the board.

One independent agent, 255 rounds of three minutes on 18 and 19 September
2026, with aamio 0.6.3 from PyPI on the command line. Its list separated what
it saw from what it guessed, and four of the things it saw were this client's:

  `board replies` said `replies: []` for twenty minutes while three verified
  messages lay on the board inbox, because it only read the inbox when it was
  given --wait;

  `board channel ... --reply-to` ended in a traceback when the message carrying
  the new address was refused, with the channel open and nothing saying so;

  `--tags` on `board post` became the runtime's presence tags, so whoami showed
  the last post's tags and presence published them;

  and a channel past its expiry was listed like any other.

(The replacement inbox that was not there after a restart is in
test_reader_resilience.py: the review of 18 September found it first.)
