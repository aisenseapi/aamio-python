"""The archive is a record of delivery, and it must not become the delivery.

One message stopped a whole batch. JSON can carry a lone surrogate, Python
parses it into a str without complaint, and UTF-8 cannot encode it, so the
archive raised on the way to disk. The raise happened after the message was
received and understood and before the next one was looked at: the second
message was never delivered and the cursor was never saved, which means it was
re-read and lost again on every poll after that.

It arrives as plain ASCII on the wire, so nothing upstream flags it and any
sender can send it.

These tests write to a real directory, because the failure was in the writing.
